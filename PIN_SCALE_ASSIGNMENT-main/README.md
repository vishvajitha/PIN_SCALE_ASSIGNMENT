# Assignment

### Common Instructions:

1. Add Loading and Failure views for all the APIs.
2.  Develop the UI exactly as in the Design screens.
3. Do client-side validations for all the input fields, forms, and request and response objects for API calls.
4. The UI should be responsive. The screens are not given, and the design is your call. You can achieve responsiveness using media queries, flex properties, etc.
5. Deploy your website in a public URL using Github Pages and share it in the README.md file of the project. If you don’t know how to deploy, you can follow the below video

- **APIs**
    
    You can check the Usage of all the APIs in the Postman Collection [here](https://www.postman.com/interstellar-firefly-777826/workspace/money-matters/collection/28254623-dcd2cdfa-4af1-49f5-bd68-a7218aedc5e7?action=share&creator=28256022).

    <aside>
    ⛔ As these are Public APIs, the responses will contain transactions added by other users too
    
    </aside>
    
    **API Headers**
    
    - Admin User
        
        ```jsx
        x-hasura-admin-secret: g08A3qQy00y8yFDq3y6N1ZQnhOPOa4msdie5EtKS1hFStar01JzPKrtKEzY
        x-hasura-role: admin
        ```
        
    - Non-Admin User
        
        ```jsx
        x-hasura-role: user
        // Fetch the user id by providing the login credentials to Get User Id API
        x-hasura-user-id: <user_id>
        ```
        
    
    <aside>
    ⛔ Ensure that the required headers are added to the API request object and role is provided as expected for the given user in the headers
